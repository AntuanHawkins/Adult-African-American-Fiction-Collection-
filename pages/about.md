## About the Collection

This site is a collaborative effort for the MLS Program of NCCU students using CB-GH. With this sample collection, we intend to do the following: 

- build a collection of fiction from the African American experience.
- build a collection with various formats that can be used a a reference to the colorful stories of African American literature.

The template repository features four objects from the University of Idaho Library's [Digital Collections](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital).
